IPFS Working Groups
=======================

> Get connected with one of the many working groups that advance IPFS.

Working Groups are regular meetings of people who are collectively working in specific arenas to advance IPFS.
- Anyone is welcome to join a Working Group and participate so long as they adhere to the [IPFS Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Just show up and jump in anywhere your interests lead.
- Despite the IPFS ecosystem team's best efforts to maintain this listing, consider it downstream of any working group's own processes and defer to the most recent notes documents in case of conflicting information.
